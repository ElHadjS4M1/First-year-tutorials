## Question 1

You are visiting an island that has two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie.
Two natives A and B address you as follows
* A says “Both of us are knights”
* B says “A is a knave.

Represent this scenario in propositional logic, construct the truth table and decide what A and B are.

### Answer
Logic:
A says "both of us are knights"
This means that A is telling the truth
But that means that B is telling the truth also, but A can't be a knight because B says it's a knave.

A is a knave, B is a knight.
A can lie and say "both of us are knights"
B is telling the truth, therefore it's a knight.

This seems logical.

* What is the output signal for the input signalsP= 0, Q= 1, R= 1?
* What logical formula in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) describes the behaviour of the circuit?
* Use equivalence laws to simplify the formula from item (b).

## Question 3
Is¬(P∧Q)logically equivalent to(¬P∧¬Q)?

## Question 4
n the lectures we’ve seen that the NAND gate (Sheffer stroke) is univesal (thatis, the NOT, AND and OR gates constructed from NAND gates). Show that theNOR gate (Pierce arrow) is also universal.

## Question 5

## Question 6
Use long addition and long subraction to compute
* 1110 + 1010
* 1110−1010
