## Question 1
Suppose that U={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}is the universal set, A={x∈N|2< x <7}, B={3,7}, and C={3,4,5,6}.

## Question 1 a
List the elements of the set B∪(A∩C)

A = 3, 4, 5, 6

### Answer
(A∩C) =  3, 4, 5, 6
B∪(A∩C) = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

## Question 1 b
What is the characteristic vector of (A∆B)∩C?

### Answer
A∆B = {4, 5, 6, 7}

(A∆B)∩C = {4, 5, 6}

## Question 2
Which of the following statements are true?

* {a, b, c}⊆{b, c, a}−{b}

So {b, c, a}−{b} is just {c, a}.
Thus the question is
is the set containing {a, b, c} a subset of the set containing {c, a}?
Well no, because the first set contains {b} and the second set doesn't.

* {a}⊆{a, b}
The set containing the element of "a" is indeed a subset of {a, b}.

* {b, c}⊆{c, b}
Yes, b, c is a subset of c, b.
The first set contains all the elements in the second set, and order doesn't matter. Thus it is a subset.

* {a, b, c}∆{b}={a, c}
{a, b, c}∆{b}
is all elements that are in set on the left and set on the right but not in both. Since the element b is in both it is removed.
{a, c}.
Thus the question becomes
{a, c} = {a, c}
Which is true for obvious reasons.

## Question 3
Which of the following statements are true

* x∈{x}
Is the singular element x an element of the set containing the element x? Yes.

* {x}⊆{x}
